## Laboratory 1 - Quarto

Deadline: 12.,10.2023

It's an terminal implementation of Quarto board game, invented by swiss mathematician, Blaise Müller. Rules are described [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/quarto/game-rules.php).

Our implementation of the game differs in that player one does not choose a pawn for player two.

## Laboratory 2 - Irrigation system (fuzzy logic)

Deadline: 26.10.2023

It's an intelligent irrigatin system based on fuzzy logic. For implementation we used scikit-fuzzy framework and paper "An intelligent irrigation system based on fuzzy logic
control: A case study for Moroccan oriental climate
region" by Benzaouia Mohammed *et al*.

The first version of the solution was accidentally placed in [another repository](https://github.com/s22051-pj-lukasz-kos/fuzzy-logic-irrigation).
