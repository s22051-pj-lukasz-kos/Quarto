In analogy with using neural networks to recognize cancer from roentgens images, we came up with quite similar,
but a little bit controversial idea. Inspired by South Park S26E03 episode called “Japanese Toilet”
where smart toilets become a symbol of status and an attempt to reaffirm one's social and financial status,
we were wondering about what improvement in that field could be a real game changer,
that could make a real difference in improving human health. Colon cancer is responsible for great deal of humans deaths,
especially for men. We propose equipping smart toilets with UV-light cameras to capture images of stool.
Having in mind that average human bowel movement generates one stool a day, it  creates enormous dataset.
This kind of dataset its perfect to process with modern neural networks. Despite of controversies, especially concerning
privacy matters that could lead to improving recognition of occult blood in stool which is a symptom of colon cancer but
also parasite infections and all sort of other symptoms.
But that leads us to a more philosophical question “Is this shit worth it?” :)

After brief research, it turned out that we are not the first crazy ones:
